### Approach taken

---

- We want to make an app to connect these people to each other and make interviews a breeze.
- Our team grouped together to discuss the user flow of our site, and through that we determined what the user would benefit from the most when it came to both navigating through the site and features.
-  The group consisted of three people. We broke down tasks by features and functionality
- If there was a problem that one group member had, we would take the steps to collaborate on how to solve the problem, and then went back to our original tasks we were working on during that day. While this sounds problematic, the resolution helped everyone by sharing different methods to approach problems, and our app was built even faster by the end of the project.
- We did break down major roles, which we used during the end of the project. These roles consisted of heroku deployment, conflict resolution, design, and QA.
